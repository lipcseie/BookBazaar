# BookBazaar: An E-commerce Platform for Books (Work in Progress)

## Introduction

Welcome to **BookBazaar**! This is an ongoing project where I'm building an e-commerce platform for books using ASP.NET MVC. The goal is to create a fully functional online bookstore.

## Project Overview

BookBazaar is a work-in-progress web application that aims to provide a platform where users can explore a wide variety of books, add them to their cart, and make purchases. The application is being developed using the **ASP.NET MVC** framework, a model-view-controller framework for building dynamic web sites with clean separation of concerns.

## Project Status

Currently, I am working on implementing the **Prodcut** feature. This feature will allow users to Create, Update, Read, Delete products.

## Planned Features

Here are some of the features that are currently being worked on for BookBazaar:

1. User Authentication: Register and log in to a personal account.
2. Product Browsing: Browse through a wide variety of books.
3. Shopping Cart: Add books to your cart and manage your orders.
4. Checkout Process.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, clone the repository to your machine. You can then open it in Visual Studio or any other .NET compatible IDE. 

## Running the Application

To run the application, start the project from your IDE. The application will open in your default web browser.
